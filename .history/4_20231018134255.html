                <li>This Estimate has been based on information provided by you. All budgets are on a provisional basis and based on prices and rates as at the date of this Estimate.</li>
                <li>This Estimate does not consider your personal financial situation and you should seek personal financial advice. Paywise does not provide any form of financial, taxation or finance product advice for Salary Packaging your Novated Lease but provides information to illustrate possible advantages as general information only.</li>
                <li>There may be a requirement to catch up some salary deductions over the first few pays to cover any shortfall. Paywise will attempt to deduct these payments over 4 pay periods and will provide you with the actual catch-up amounts prior to the deductions commencing.</li>
                <li>If GST on pre-tax deductions is to be paid by your employer, this will begin once spending has commenced from your lease benefit with the amount of GST incurred reported monthly. The payment into your account will depend on the completion of your employer’s Business Activity Statement (BAS) to the ATO, thus the first 4 salary deductions may be GST inclusive as a result.</li>
                <li>Budgeted running costs are estimates which have been based on the car, lease term and annual kilometres of travel nominated by you. All incurred expenditure must be collected via packaging deductions. Should actual spending exceed the estimated amounts, you agree that Paywise may request an increase in salary contributions to cover the excess. Any money that is surplus to your expenditure will be returned to your employer, following lease benefit reconciliation, to be paid to you as taxable salary via payroll..</li>
                <li>The payment of reimbursement claims or direct payments (such as vehicle registration), will be dependent on your Novated Lease benefit having sufficient funds to cover the expenses, without putting your account into deficit. This ensures sufficient funds are available to fund 1 month’s finance and insurance payment (Paywise Insurance only). The claim/direct payment will be held until sufficient funds are available, or you can request additional deductions to accelerate the reimbursement/direct payment.</li>
                <li>The car will be registered (and insured) in your name. Renewal notifications will be sent to you. It is your responsibility to ensure that the car is always registered and insured, and your postal address detail is updated whenever necessary. The registration and insurance renewal will be posted to you by the relevant state authority and insurer. You can provide it to Paywise for direct payment provided there are sufficient funds in your lease account (see 6 above) and the renewal is received by Paywise a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the renewal date. Inside this timeframe you will need to pay the renewal and then seek reimbursement.</li>
                <li>To effectively monitor your lease, you are requested to provide your vehicle’s odometer reading each time you re-fuel your car when using the provided fuel card. The monthly fee for the fuel card has been incorporated into your fuel budget.</li>
                <li>If Paywise or your Employer incurs any costs for collecting any outstanding liabilities from you, you will be responsible for reimbursing those costs to Paywise or your Employer.</li>
                <li>This Estimate is to be read in conjunction with the Paywise Salary Packaging Terms and Conditions available at <a href="www.paywise.com.au/documents/" class="txt-link">www.paywise.com.au/documents/</a>.</li>
                <li>Paywise or related entities and agents may receive fees or commissions from a product and/or service in relation to this Novated Lease which has been included in this Estimate.</li>
                <li>If Paywise is sourcing your car, and upon obtaining unconditional finance approval, you acknowledge that the signing of this estimate will pre-empt an irrevocable Order Confirmation requesting that Paywise to purchase and deliver the vehicle described in this Estimate. Cancellation of the Order, once it has been placed, may result in you being liable for any costs incurred, including costs associated with the supply and fitting of accessories/aftermarket products and/or cancellation charge.</li>
                <li>If you elect to exit your novated lease agreement earlier than the scheduled end date for any reason, Paywise will not be held responsible for any charges, fees or penalty amounts payable to the lease financier because of the early exit, including any residual amount or part thereof.</li>
